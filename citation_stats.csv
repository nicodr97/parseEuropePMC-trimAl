For VERTEBRATA, BMGE, HmmCleaner and TrimAl all slightly decreased accuracy (64.83%, 65.23% and 65.28% versus 65.64%). The performance of HmmCleaner is interesting, because it removes more residues than BMGE and TrimAl (5.6% versus 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively).

The performance of HmmCleaner is interesting, because it removes more residues than BMGE and TrimAl (5.6% versus 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively). HmmCleaner thus appears to discard almost exclusively segments that are poorly informative for inferring phylogeny, which is expected because it removes low similarity segments. Accordingly, a random  [...] a filtering should be.In contrast, the MAMMALIA dataset demonstrated the positive effect of using HmmCleaner on genomic-based datasets, which are more likely to contain annotation errors: accuracy improved from 63.19% to 66.30% for nt MSAs. BMGE and TrimAl also increased accuracy, but less than HmmCleaner (63.59% and 63.77%, respectively), while the random removal of characters expectedly decreased accuracy (62.59%). PREQUAL is in between (64.77%), probably because of its reduced sensitivity (al [...] ltering methods have different targets (primary sequence and alignment errors, respectively), it could be of interest to combine them, as already done in practice for recent large phylogenomic matrices [30, 32, 33]. To test this, we applied BMGE and TrimAl on the MAMMALIA and VERTEBRATA alignments already cleaned by HmmCleaner. Data loss was important, especially for VERTEBRATA (~ 13.5%), potentially increasing the impact of stochastic error. Accordingly, for VERTEBRATA, the combination of the t [...] 46.52% for HmmCleaner+BMGE). These contrasted results illustrate the difficulty of data filtering, data loss increasing stochastic error while decreasing reconstruction errors.In conclusion of this section, HmmCleaner is more efficient than BMGE and TrimAl, and to a lesser extent than PREQUAL, at improving topological accuracy for genome-based MSAs, whereas filtering methods slightly decrease accuracy for transcriptome-based MSAs. When primary sequence errors are not negligible, the increase of  [...] le, the increase of stochastic error due to data filtering is overcome by the reduction of non-phylogenetic signal. More generally, the better performance of segment-filtering methods (HmmCleaner and PREQUAL) versus block-filtering methods (BMGE and TrimAl) suggests that primary sequence errors (especially annotation errors) are more detrimental to phylogenetic inference than alignment errors.Since primary sequence errors had only limited (yet detectable) impact on topological accuracy, we wonde [...] lar to the one of raw nt MSAs (0.749 and 0.778). PREQUAL performed similarly to HmmCleaner, but was slightly less efficient, even for VERTEBRATA (Fig. 6), likely because of its lowest sensitivity. In sharp contrast, block-filtering methods (BMGE and TrimAl) had virtually no impact, even when applied after HmmCleaner. Segment-filtering methods seem thus to be more efficient than block-filtering methods to remove primary sequence errors affecting branch-length estimates. This is in agreement with  [...] g branch-length estimates. This is in agreement with our hypothesis that primary sequence errors, which are the target of HmmCleaner and PREQUAL, are more detrimental to evolutionary inferences than alignment errors, which are the target of BMGE and TrimAl.Fig. 6Distribution of correlation coefficients of branch lengths between single gene-tree and the corresponding concatenated tree in different configurations on the VERTEBRATA dataset (a) and the MAMMALIA dataset (b).
